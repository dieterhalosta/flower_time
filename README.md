# Inspiration
I wanted to learn how to make React.js web apps.

The app architecture/structure is mostly based on ideas I've seen in the Complete React Development course on Udemy.com and plants.com. 

# Development stack
+ [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
+ [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
+ I used [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as my Database and user authentification.
+ I used [Stipe](https://stripe.com/) to process user payments and orders.
+ I used git for version control, and stored progress on GitHub.
+ Currently only tested on an iOS device

# APIs
+ Payment processing was implemented using Stripe (https://stripe.com/)

# External packages
+ [react-redux]
+ [react-router-dom]
+ [reselect]
+ [styled-components]
